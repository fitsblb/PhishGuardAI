3. **Memorize key numbers:**
   - 99.92% PR-AUC
   - 0.09% False Positive Rate
   - 89% Automation rate
   - 8 features (URL-only)
4. **Practice out loud:**
   - Elevator pitch (3x)
   - Training/serving skew story (3x)
   - SHAP explanation for facebook1mob.com (2x)

### Morning of Interview (30 minutes)
1. **Test services start correctly:**
   ```bash
   python -m model_svc.main  # Terminal 1
   set MODEL_SVC_URL=http://localhost:9000
   python -m gateway.main     # Terminal 2
   ```
2. **Run 3 quick tests:**
   - github.com (whitelist)
   - phishing.top (BLOCK)
   - npm.org (judge)
3. **Open SHAP dashboard** - Verify it loads: http://localhost:8000/explain

### During Interview
- [ ] Have DEMO_SCRIPT.md open for reference
- [ ] Have INTERVIEW_PREP.md printed or on second screen
- [ ] Run demo if they ask for live walkthrough
- [ ] Show SHAP dashboard (biggest differentiator)
- [ ] Tell training/serving skew story if opportunity arises

## üé§ INTERVIEW STRATEGY

### For Michael Nar (Head of Data & Analytics - Strategic)
**Focus on:**
- Business value: 0.09% FP rate, 89% automation, cost savings
- How this reduces operational load on security teams
- Connection to Helcim's merchant trust and compliance needs
- Explain how this scales (shadow mode ‚Üí canary ‚Üí production)

### For Catherine Rawlek (Data Scientist - Technical)
**Focus on:**
- Model details: XGBoost, isotonic calibration, ablation studies
- Training/serving skew bug story (shows debugging rigor)
- SHAP explainability (feature attribution methodology)
- Threshold optimization (ROC analysis, gray zone tuning)
- Be ready for: "Walk me through your training notebook"

### For Sam Elliott (Manager, Data Platform - Operational)
**Focus on:**
- Operational maturity: Docker, Great Expectations, observability
- Deployment strategy (shadow mode ‚Üí canary ‚Üí full production)
- Monitoring & alerting (Prometheus, Grafana, PagerDuty)
- Data drift detection plan (PSI monitoring, retraining triggers)
- Be ready for: "How would you deploy this at scale?"

## üö® CRITICAL REMINDERS

**DO:**
‚úÖ Lead with business value (0.09% FP rate saves Helcim money + trust)  
‚úÖ Use concrete numbers (99.92% PR-AUC, not "the model is accurate")  
‚úÖ Tell the training/serving skew story (shows debugging skills)  
‚úÖ Demo the SHAP dashboard (biggest differentiator)  
‚úÖ Frame limitations as "future work" (not "problems")  
‚úÖ Connect everything to Helcim's payment fraud use case  
‚úÖ Be enthusiastic but humble

**DON'T:**
‚ùå Apologize for known limitations  
‚ùå Say "I would have done X differently" (own your decisions)  
‚ùå Over-explain (let them ask questions)  
‚ùå Claim perfection (acknowledge performance bottleneck)  
‚ùå Use vague language ("good performance" ‚Üí "99.92% PR-AUC")

## üéì FINAL CONFIDENCE BOOSTERS

**You've built something impressive:**
- Most ML projects stop at model training
- You went end-to-end: training ‚Üí serving ‚Üí deployment ‚Üí explainability
- You found and fixed a real bug (training/serving skew)
- You added production touches (whitelist, routing, SHAP, Great Expectations)
- You documented everything professionally

**Remember:**
- **Story > Perfection** - The training/serving skew bug makes you MORE credible
- **Concrete > Vague** - "99.92% PR-AUC" beats "the model is accurate"
- **Humble + Learning** - "Here's what I'd improve" shows maturity

**You've got this!** üöÄ
